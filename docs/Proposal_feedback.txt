Good proposal.

Project seems a little ambitious, but is nicely decomposed into many individual
components.

I'm not familiar with infrastructure-as-a-service components.  It seems likely,
but be sure that your application is doing enough interesting work (in Rust),
not simply shuffling requests from a front-end web API through to a back-end
service.

Think some more about how you will test your application and components.
