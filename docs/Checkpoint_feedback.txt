Reasonable update and progress.

Seems like some implemention underway.

Good to get experience with async and tokio.

Modularizing each component as a crate seems like a reasonable organization.  Of
course, there may well be some "private" crates that are used by multiple
components (rather than duplicating code in each crate).

Continue to think about how you will test your components.

I think that you suggested that there is a standard "infrastructure as a
service" demo application that you hope to recreate.

Look over the rubric for the final project writeup
(https://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/teaching/20215/psr/project.html#final_project) and
think about how the features of Rust were used to good effect in the project.
Also be sure that your final writeup gives a more complete sense of the effort
and accomplishments of the project.


Score: 10/10
